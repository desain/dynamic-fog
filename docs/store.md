# Dynamic Fog

Add walls, doors and lights for a simple dynamic fog experience

## Add a Light

To add a light you can select any image in a Scene and click the Add Light button in the context menu.

![Add light context menu item](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owlbear-rodeo/dynamic-fog/main/docs/light.jpg)

Once added you can adjust your lights settings as needed using the Light Settings panel.

![Light settings context menu item](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owlbear-rodeo/dynamic-fog/main/docs/settings.jpg)

A description of the settings are listed below:

| Menu Item | Description                                                                  |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Range     | The radius of the light in the current units of the Scene                    |
| Angle     | Whether the light should be a full circle or a cone                          |
| Edge      | Whether the edge of the light should be solid or blurred                     |
| Type      | Whether the light should be a primary or secondary light. More details below |

To remove a light you can click the Remove Light button at the bottom of the Light Settings

## Add a Wall

Walls are automatically created from the fog shapes of the native Owlbear Rodeo fog tools.
For a guide on using the native fog tool see [here](https://docs.owlbear.rodeo/docs/fog/).

## Add a Door

A door can be added to any wall by using the Door tool in the fog toolbar.

![Door tool](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owlbear-rodeo/dynamic-fog/main/docs/doorTool.jpg)

With the door tool selected drag on the edge of any fog shape to create a door. This looks like the left side of the image below.
Once a door has been created it is represented by a path showing the extent of the door as well as a door icon showing the center of the door.
These controls will only show when the fog tool is selected.
When a door is closed the door path will be red and the door icon will show a closed door. This can be seen in the center image below.
When a door is opened the door path will be green and the door icon will show an open door. This can be seen in the right image below.

With the door tool selected you can open/close a door by clicking it.
Also with the door tool selected you can delete a door by double clicking it.

## Secondary Lighting

Each light can be marked as either primary or secondary.
This is controlled by the Type option in the Light Settings.
The person icon represents a primary light while the campfire icon represents a secondary.
A primary light is a regular shadow casting light that when visible will always cut away from the fog.
A secondary light however only effects fog that can be seen by a primary light.
For example setting a light above the enemies campfire as secondary will mean that the camp will only be visible once a player with a primary light gains line of sight to that fire.
