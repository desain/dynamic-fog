/**
 * The Reconciler is responsible for hooking into the shared scene item
 * state and producing diffs when changes happen.
 * These diffs are passed into registered Reactors who manage creating local children
 * for these shared items.
 * This is a one way data binding not two way.
 * This means it is simpler but has some caveats to be aware of.
 * As it can only react to changes in the shared scene (not the local scene) we need to limit
 * the types of local children created.
 * Specifically they should be unselectable (disable hit) and have COPY attachment disabled.
 * This is because if a local item is deleted or added outside of the reconciler we don't know about it.
 * This could lead to an invalid state if not careful.
 * If this is an issue a two way data binding system should be used instead.
